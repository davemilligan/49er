49er 
====
### A File management tool for Textpad.

The 49er is happy to work from TextPad 4.* or 5.* but can probably be modified to work equally well
using your preferred Text Editor. I leave that to you as an exercise.

For now 49er needs to be installed to 'C:\49er'


1. Navigate to the install directory for your OS.
2. Run the 'SaveExistingSettingsAndPreferences.bat' file to save your existing tools and preferences to the temp folder.
3. Run the 'InstallToolsAndPreferences.bat' file to install tools and default preferences.
4. Configure 49er using fortyninercfg.rb.
